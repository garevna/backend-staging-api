<p> A fiber optic power meter measures the amount of power coming out of a fiber, just like a voltmeter measures voltage.</p>
<p>See FOTP- 95, the standard test procedure for power measurement.</p>
<p>When used with a test source, it can be used to measure the end-to-end loss of a fiber optic cable or installed cable plant. FOTP-171, OFSTP-14 and OFSTP-7 cover this test.</p>
<p>OTDRs work like "optical radar" to find faults in cables, measure length or test loss of splices in cables.</p>
<p>They are used for troubleshooting or for documentation of outside plant cables that have splices (splicing is not often used in premises cabling).</p>
<p>Here is a more detailed explanation of all the options in cable testing.</p>
<p>See this page for more info on OTDRs.</p>
