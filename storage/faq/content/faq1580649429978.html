<p>The answer is maybe you can use SM connectors on MM but NOT the reverse.</p>
<p>SM connectors are made to tighter tolerances - as is SM fiber - so the ferrule hole may be too small for some MM fibers.</p>
<p>MM connectors have bigger holes for the fiber and will have high loss (&gt;1dB) with SM.</p>
<p>Also MM connectors may not be PC (physical contact) polish - terrible for return loss.</p>
<p>MM fiber may not fit the smaller hole in SM connectors.</p>
