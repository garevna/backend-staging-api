<p>Modal bandwidth is caused by the fact that light in multimode fiber travels in rays or "modes" that take different times to get to through the fiber, causing dispersion.</p>
<p>The longer the fiber, the greater the effect.</p>
<p>This is a major factor in the distance limitation of GBE and the incentive for fiber manufacturers to develop better multimode fiber.</p>
<p>While the worst case distance for 62.5/125 FDDI-spec fiber using a 850 nm VCSEL source is only 220 m, laser-optimized 50/125 fiber capable of 1 km is now available.</p>
