<p><strong>The normal way to test fiber on the reel is</strong>:</p><p>1. Physical examination of the reel and content. Any sign of physical damage means you should test very carefully to insure the cable or fiber has not been damaged. You can also read the distance numbers off the cable to determine the length of cable on the reel.</p><p>2. Continuity test using a visible light source. MM can use a flashlight fiber tracer or a 650 nm (red) LED source. Cleave the fiber and use a bare fiber adapter or unterminated connector on the end of the fiber. SM fiber should use a visible laser fault locator .</p><p>3. If you really need to do a loss test (usually a contractual issue, not a technical issue, as the cable was tested thoroughly at the manufacturer before shipment) you can do a cutback test with a meter and source or a OTDR test.</p><p>3a. Source and meter: Use a launch cable with the source and a bare fiber adapter on the fiber off the reel to connect to the fiber. Measure the power at the far end of the cable again with a bare fiber adapter, then come back to the source end and cut off the fiber on the cable about 2-3 feet from the launch cable connection. Measure the power there - without touching the connection of the fiber under test to the launch cable ! The difference in the power measurements is the loss of the cable. Divide by the length to get the attenuation in dB/km.</p><p>3b. OTDR: Use a long launch cable on the OTDR and a bare fiber adapter on the fiber to test. Using a little index matching fluid will reduce the reflection and loss of the connection. Read the signature for attenuation and any localized stress losses.</p><p>Other references:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thefoa.org/fotm.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Fiber Optic Technicians Manual</em>&nbsp;</a>has a chapter (17) on testing and Lennie Lightwave has a section on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jimhayes.com/lennielw/test.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testing</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jimhayes.com/OTDR/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full article on OTDRs</a>.</p>
