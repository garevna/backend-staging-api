After being knocked back by all of the major telcos, the Owners Corporation contacted DGtek, who had their engineers promptly inspect the site. Whilst the project would be complex, it was feasible. The DGtek team worked in close cooperation with the Owners Corporation in order to ensure that the installation process ran smoothly, quickly and with no disruption to residents. After only 2 weeks, the building was rewired with optical fibre and DGtek began connecting individual apartments. Today, the oldest private high-rise development in Melbourne boasts Australiaâ€™s fastest Internet speeds. The installation was followed by a straightforward, yet efficient marketing campaign: try the service for free for two weeks, with no strings attached. Having experienced the superior speeds, not a single user went back.
