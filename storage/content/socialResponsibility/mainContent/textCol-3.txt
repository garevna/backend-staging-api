I know that people will ask about evening speeds and international speeds – but at this stage, I cannot comment, but later I will be installing a kiosk laptop or desktop for the teachers and this will give me an opportunity to Teamviewer in the evening times to test and comment back. For us, it has saved us money as we have cancelled our ADSL service + landline, but it has also expanded the opportunities for e-learning and tools for the teachers. Two years ago I organised Google Apps for Education, but with ADSL the user experience was abysmal – for instance, when trying to send email scans from the photocopier. Now, its almost instant!
