<p>We have DGTek GPON Fiber installed at our Saturday Language School in Elwood. I facilitated the install with DGTek. I noticed them when reading a news.com.au article in the Technology section over a year and a half ago and they mentioned that, as a philanthropic gesture to the community, they would offer a free (100/100) internet connection to schools in their coverage area. I sent an email out to them and we got it installed this year in early February. </p><p>Needless to say it is rock solid and doing a speed test on my LG G6 connected to an older airport extreme I got 115 Mbps download and 117 Mbps upload with a ping of 2ms and Jitter of 2ms. Im not sure how much 'faster' it would be on a wired connection. The install was done professionally and with no disruption to the property. We had recently updated the outdoor area for the students with artificial turf and landscaped gardening and they installed the conduit via the garden bed without any mess or impact to the area. The conduit itself is only 5mm in diameter and super flexible, so the tools needed to trench are only special hand tools.</p>
